"People get nervous when I smile."

"That’s not the case with Sam, though."

"People around here have come to expect a sort of coldness from him."

"So when he smiles it looks sweet enough to thaw winter."

"But he’s in a bad mood again."

"It has to be because of Nik."

"There’s still some frostiness between the two of them."

"It ain't usual to see Nik that distant from Sam."

"But then again,  Sam had been treating us like strangers for the last few weeks."

"At least I know he’s not lying to me anymore, now."

"But I guess what’s good enough for me ain't always enough for Nik."

"It’s a good thing that that weasel didn’t come with us."

"The both of us don’t need to be more on edge."

"I’m glad he said no when Nik suggested he stay at the office."

"Because he really {i}should{/i} say no."

"At least, if he has any shame."

"He already put Sam in danger."

"Twice."
"If his mouth leads a goddamn lynch mob to Sam or Nik and gets them killed, I might up and join the next one."

"That bullet already broke the skin on the Byrnes boy."

"I feel like I’m in the calm of a hurricane before the storm comes."
"I think I was right about disaster following this weasel, but I don’t think he’s the only one stirring up trouble by far."
"Considering the way Huxley died, and with Cliff having ties to James, I’m almost certain now that the rat didn’t place the hit on the stoat."
"But if that’s the case, then how did he get the gun?"
"And if Cliff is telling the truth, then why was Reed trying to break into his apartment?"
"Did they plan the hit together and then something happened to Mr. Greene before he lost the gun?"
"Maybe."
"I’ll have to have a chat with Reed again before I have any reason to believe he has that much spite."
"Because as of now, that still don’t make much sense to me."
"I’d pin down Reed as a guy willing to get his own hands dirty."
"Or to start shit when he’s bored."
"He could definitely beat a man to death in broad daylight if he were mad and drunk enough."
"But plotting a murder while sober?"
"I just can’t see it."
"If the two of them already jumped this weasel in broad daylight then what’s the point of giving a kid a traceable gun to take care of him in secret?"
"Maybe they just fucked it up."
"Simple as that."
"Case closed."
"...but then how did he get his goddamn head severed?"
"I have more than a few things to consider now."
"I could go to the mayor and have a little chat about how things are going."
"...Any time, really. He spends most of his time in his office doing nothing when there isn’t a ribbon to cut or a speech to unload."
"And he has no real jurisdiction over me."
"Or I could go to the Stag that Nik and the Byrnes boy keep bringing up from time to time."
"It’s the biggest men’s club in town."
"And more importantly, I know that the mining union tends to congregate there."
"Perhaps the suggestion to go wouldn’t be a waste of time after all."
"Tricky thing is... wherever I go first will take all day."
"If I want Nik’s help at the Stag, it will have to be at night."
"But if I want a more private audience with the mayor, and I don’t WANT Nik there at the Stag with me, I should maybe go to the Stag first."
